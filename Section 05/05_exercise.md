**Ranges**

If you are new to Java or Groovy the idea of an Enum might be new. An Enum is a collection of constant values. We can use this collection of constants to create ranges. I want you to do some reading up on enum's and create an enum for days of the week. ex Sunday, Monday, etc...

- Create a range from that enum
- Print the size of the Range
- Use the contains method to see if Wednesday is in that Range
- Print the from element of this range
- Print the to element of this range

**Lists**

- Create a list days (Sun - Sat)
- Print out the list
- Print the size of the list
- Remove Saturday from the list
- Add Saturday back by appending it to the list
- Print out the Wednesday using its index

**Maps**

- Create a map of days of the week
  - 1: Sunday, 2:Monday, etc...
- Print out the map
- Print out the class name of the map
- Print the size of the map
- Is there a method that would easily print out all of the days (values)? 
  - Without closures you may have to look at the Java API for LinkedHashMap
