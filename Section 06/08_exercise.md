Closure Basics

- Locate the class groovy.lang.Closure and spend a few minutes looking through documentation.
- Create a Method that accepts a closure as an argument
- Create a closure that performs some action
- Call the method and pass the closure to it.
- Create a list and use them each to iterate over each item in the list and print it out
- Hint - You can use the implicit it or use your own variable
- Create a map of data and iterate over it using each method. 
- This method can take a closure that accepts 1 or 2 arguments. 
- Use 2 arguments and print out the key and value on each line.
- Demonstrate the use of curry and try to come up with an example different from the one we used in the lecture. 

**Explore the GDK**

In the following exercises, we are going to explore the GDK to find some methods that take closures and learn how to use them. Hint - I would narrow your search to java.util.Collection, java.lang.Iterable & java.util.List

- Search for the find and findAll methods.
	- What is the difference between the two? 
	- Write some code to show how they both work.
- Search for the any and every methods.
	- What is the difference between the two? 
	- Write some code to show how they both work. 
- Search for the method groupBy that accepts a closure
	- What does this method do? 
	- Write an example of how to use this method.
